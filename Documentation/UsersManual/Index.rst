Users - Views 
-------------

The default view is fullcalendar's "Agenda Week" view. This view is optimal for appointments with time information. 
The controls on the right also let the user switch between monthly and per day view, the latter is forced as default for mobilde devices or small screens.

Users - Creating and Editing
----------------------------

Users can create and edit appointments right in the frontend. Just click on any spot in the timeline and a popup window for all necessary properties appears:
- Title: the title of the appointment.
- Description: A short description of the appointment.
- Participants: A list of other frontend-users to invite to this appointment.
- From/To: The date-time range of the appointment, prefilled with the selected date.
- Reminder From: Automatic reminder e-mails will be send after this date, prefilled with the current date.
Note: The currently logged in frontend user is saved as the creator of the appointment.

The appointment can then be edited again, by simply clicking on it, or moving it to a desired date.
